A website for displaying the required marketcap required for a CryptoCurrency coin to hit a specific price. This site is just a joke, it's not meant to be taken seriously. Have fun with it.

## Equation

To figure out the marketcap (m) of a project, you just need the circulating supply (c) and the current market price (p). c \* p = m
